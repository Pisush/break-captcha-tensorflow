Break the captcha + PIN code, as part of a [Blacklight](https://blacklight.ai) challenge: disable a security camera.

Per default, only the case of not incorrect PIN and not incorrect captcha, i.e. what is likely to be the correct PIN+captcha combination, will be printed. For displaying the logs, run with flag  `-printlog=true`

As part of the [GopherAcademy Advents Calendar series](https://blog.gopheracademy.com/advent-2017/tensorflow-and-go/) I wrote a more detailed explanation of the code.

This code is also the base for [my talks on the use of TensorFlow with Go](https://github.com/Pisush/Public-Speaking#talks) from 2018, e.g. at [Gotham Go](http://gothamgo.com/speakers/index).
